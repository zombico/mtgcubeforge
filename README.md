Summary

This project was built to showcase how React's dynamic prop passing can be used to create rich, content-based experiences.  

The app is structured in three major places:

1. Browser/frontend
2. Express node server
3. Heroku/Mongo cloud

Much of the app logic is actually loaded on the front-end, keeping the transactional data limited to text-based json objects.
